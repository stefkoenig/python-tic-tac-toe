# Python Tic Tac Toe

As part of [The Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/9373062?start=0) course on Udemy, the first milestone project was to create a game of Tic Tac Toe in Python that two players could play.

Here were the [requirements](https://github.com/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp/blob/master/Milestone%20Project%201-%20Assignment.ipynb):

* 2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
* The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
* You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board

To run, clone locally. Ensure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. In the terminal from your python-tic-tac-toe repo, run `python3 tictactoe.py`. Enjoy!
